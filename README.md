# Car Dealer API

An API for Car Dealer to add/remove car, alter car stock, search car by make/model, and get list of cars

Created by Timotius Hansel Kenny as a technical test assesment for Junior Developer position at OracleCMS

## Get started

Build the project in Visual Studio. 
I used Visual Studio 2019, and ASP.NET Core 3.1 as the framework. 
So you also need to install SDK for ASP.NET Core 3.1

Then run the API in Visual Studio.

Navigate to [localhost:5001/swagger](https://localhost:5001/swagger). You should see your app running.
